### Common Issues

**Game won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed: `python3 --version`
- Check that all files are in the correct directory structure
- Try running with `python3 main.py` instead of `python main.py`

**ASCII art looks wrong:**
- Use a terminal with Unicode support
- Ensure your terminal is at least 80 characters wide
- Try a different terminal application if issues persist

**Input not working:**
- Make sure to press Enter after typing your choice
- Only use the numbers specified in the prompts (1, 2, or 3)
- Check that your keyboard layout is set correctly

### Performance Issues
